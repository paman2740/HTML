    <h1>Demo of the :visited selector</h1>

    <p>The :visited selector style links to pages you have already visited:</p>

    <a href="https://www.wku.edu">WKU</a><br>
    <a href="https://www.eku.edu">EKU</a><br>
    <a href="https://www.nku.edu">NKU</a>
    <!--
        The:visited pseudo-class selector can change some of the styling on an anchor link (<a>) 
        element if the user’s browser has already visited the link. It’s meant to help users 
        distinguish the difference between links they have and haven’t visited.

    Limitations and usage
        There is some privacy concern about: visited, namely that a malicious website could have 
        links to tons of websites with: visited styling, then test the visual style of the links with 
        JavaScript to report back to a server which sites the user has visited. This violates the 
        user’s privacy and could potentially reveal personally identifying information.
